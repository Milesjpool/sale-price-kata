# Backlog
## Done
- Status endpoint
  
 > As an API consumer     
 > I want a simple health-check endpoint at `/status`
 > So that I know the API service is running

## Doing
- Data-dump endpoint
  
 > As a front-end developer     
 > I want a structured dump of all known data
 > So that I can begin building a suitable UI

## To do
- Paginate data-dump
- Add percentile data
- Latitude filter (query vs resource)
- Longitude filter (query vs resource)
- Lat/long and/or filter (point vs cross)
- Filter context (+- n rows/cols)
- Handle resales.
